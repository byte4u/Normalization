# Normalization
 Welcome to this class. In this class we will study normalization. 
 A feature of the database designer's job is the use of standardization 
 techniques. These techniques dictate rules for redesigning some tables, 
 in order to increase the quality of data modeling, avoid redundant data, 
 and improve data organization. Normalization has a set of rules that, when 
 applied to the model, aim to adjust the modeling for a model that:
- Minimize the use of disk space for the database;
- Eliminate repeated data (redundancies) through auxiliary relationship tables;
- Increase query performance;   
- Optimizes data organization;
